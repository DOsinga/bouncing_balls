# Bouncing Balls

Demo app to show how to use rtree and pygame to show a bunch of bouncing balls, bouncing off each other and the walls

After cloning the repository, pip install -r requirements.txt should do the trick. 
You might have trouble with `libspatialindex`, which is required by  `r-tree` but Google is your friend.

R-Tree is a nice implementation of spatial indexes in Python, while PyGame isn't a bad choice to show visualizations of
for example simulations.
